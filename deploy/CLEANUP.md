# Weekly build cleanup

Every deploy rebuilds the images, and docker keeps the pieces of each build
so the next one is faster. Nothing ever throws them away, and on this box
they once filled the disk.

Once a week, on Sunday at 04:30 UTC, an hour after the nightly backup:

| Step | What goes | What stays |
|---|---|---|
| `docker builder prune --filter until=168h` | build files not used for a week | anything the last week of deploys used, so the next build is still quick |
| `docker builder prune --max-used-space 3gb` | the oldest build files, until at most 3 GB are left | the newest 3 GB, for a week with many deploys |
| `docker image prune` | images no container uses and no tag points at | every image a container is running |
| `df -h /` | nothing | prints disk use into the log, so the effect can be read back |

Volumes are never touched. The database and every plot live in volumes.

## Install, once

```bash
ssh ubuntu@140.245.2.74
cd ~/app/visdom-dev && git pull
sudo install -m 644 deploy/visdom-prune.service deploy/visdom-prune.timer /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now visdom-prune.timer
systemctl list-timers visdom-prune.timer
```

## Run it now, and read what it did

```bash
sudo systemctl start visdom-prune.service
journalctl -u visdom-prune -n 20 --no-pager
```

The log shows how much space each step reclaimed, then the disk use after.

## Turn it off

```bash
sudo systemctl disable --now visdom-prune.timer
```
