"""Bypassing plan limits, for one account or for every account.

A bypass that lifted most limits would be worse than none, since the one it
missed would be found by a customer in the middle of a promotion. So every
limit a plan sets is pinned here: workspaces, API keys, team members, storage
and how long work is kept. The other half is that the plan is left alone, so
switching the bypass off puts back exactly what was there.
