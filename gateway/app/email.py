"""Outbound email, through whichever SMTP relay the settings name.

The live deployment is meant to use Brevo. Until `SMTP_HOST` and `MAIL_FROM` are
set nothing is sent: `configured()` is false and `send()` logs what would have
gone out and returns False. Anything that must not act as though a message was
delivered checks `configured()`, or the result of `send()`, first.

Port 465 speaks TLS from the start; anything else upgrades with STARTTLS, which
is what Brevo recommends on 587.
