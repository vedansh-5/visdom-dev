"""Turn the instances' live counters into a durable hourly record.

What an instance reports is cumulative since that instance last started, so a
sample is worth only its difference from the one before. Three things make that
harder than it sounds, and each is handled here rather than left to chance.

The difference is taken per instance, never on a sum across them. A restart is
only visible in the instance that had it; on the sum it looks like every other
instance's total vanishing.

The last totals seen are kept in the database, per instance and workspace, so a
gateway restart or a different worker taking the next tick carries on from where
the last one stopped. A workspace seen for the first time is only given a
baseline: there is no way to know how much of its total was banked before.

Only one worker samples a given tick. The gateway runs several, each with its
own timer, and two of them folding the same interval would count it twice. A
Postgres advisory lock taken for the length of the tick's transaction decides
which one; the others skip. The instances are read after the lock is taken, so
the totals used are always at least as new as the baseline they are compared to.

Active minutes are not differenced. Each instance reports which minutes of an
hour had work in them as a mask, masks from different instances are unioned, and
the count lands on the hour the mask belongs to, keeping the highest seen.
