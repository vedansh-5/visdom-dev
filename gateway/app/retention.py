"""Removing the work a workspace's plan no longer keeps.

Every plan states how far back it keeps data and, until this, nothing acted on
it, so the free plan's seven days and the paid plan's ninety meant the same
thing: forever. The window belongs to the account that owns the workspace, the
same rule the storage limit follows, because the workspace is what the plan is
sold against and a member on a bigger plan should not quietly extend it.

Deleting is off by default. ``RETENTION_ENFORCE`` starts false so a deployment
runs this as a report for a while first, and what it says it would remove can be
read before anything is gone. That matters more here than anywhere else in the
product, because this is the one job whose whole purpose is destroying work.

The instances behind the proxy share one disk, so the sweep has to reach the
instance that actually holds a workspace. Each one is asked first, in report
mode, and the one that says it holds it is the one told to remove. When none
holds it, the workspace is dormant and any instance can sweep its files.
