Closing an account: a request, a waiting period, then removal.

A request stops the account working straight away but removes nothing. Signing
in during the next ``GRACE_DAYS`` cancels it. After that the account goes for
good, and so do the workspaces nobody else was using.

A workspace other people still use never goes with the account. Its owner, or
its only admin, has to put someone else in charge first, so a team is never
left holding a workspace nobody can run.
