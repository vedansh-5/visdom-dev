"""Who may see and do what in the admin panel.

Three roles, in increasing privilege: support handles the day to day incident,
admin decides what a customer is entitled to, and superadmin decides who has
console access at all.

Reading every user's data is itself a privilege, so the role decides which
models are visible rather than only which actions are allowed. Visibility,
change, removal and creation are answered separately, and a role that may
change a model is restricted again to the fields it may set. That separation is
what keeps "suspend an account" from also meaning "edit an account".
