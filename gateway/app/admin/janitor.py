Finds the leftovers a running deployment accumulates.

None of these are errors on their own, and none are deleted here. They are the
rows that stop matching reality over time: a workspace nobody belongs to, a key
issued and never used, an invite to someone who has since signed up. Left alone
they are what turns into a manual cleanup against the live database, which has
already happened once here with 268 orphaned workspace directories.
