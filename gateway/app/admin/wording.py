"""Turning an audit entry into a sentence a person can read.

An entry is stored as an action, a kind of record and the values that were
set, which is the right shape to keep and the wrong one to read: nobody should
have to decode ``{"is_active": false}`` to learn that an account was suspended.
The stored entry is left as it is. This only decides how it is shown.
