"""
Records what staff change through the admin panel.

sqladmin already emits an entry for every create, update and delete it performs,
so this only has to say where those entries go and who made them. Note that the
entry is written in its own transaction, after the change has committed: a crash
in between loses the record rather than the change, so this is a trail for
answering "who did that", not a ledger the data depends on.
