"""The subscription plan catalog and per-tier limits, read from the database.

Plans used to be a constant in this module, so changing what a tier included
meant a code change and a deploy. They now live in the `plans` table and are
edited from the admin console; this module stays the one place that reads them,
so nothing that asks about a limit needs to know where plans are stored.

Two different questions are asked of a plan and they have different answers.
What an account may pick for itself is only what is public and not archived,
since changing plan needs no payment yet and a hidden internal tier must not be
one click away. What staff may assign is anything not archived. And an account
already on an archived plan keeps that plan's limits: archiving stops new
assignments, it does not take anything away.

A `None` limit means unlimited.
